# **Bryan Godwin - Week 10 Challenge**

## **Team Profile Generator**

### This challenge is to build a node.js application that takes information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an html webpage that displays summaries for each person.

### **User Story**

    AS A manager
    I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
    SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

### **Acceptance Critera**

1.  User can search for a city

        WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
        THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input

2.  User can see detailed weather results for a search

        WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
        THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address

3.  UV results are detailed

        WHEN I click on the GitHub username
        THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab

4.  User is presented with detailed 5-day forecast for a search

        WHEN I start the application
        THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number

5.  User can quickly view results of prior searches

        WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
        THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
